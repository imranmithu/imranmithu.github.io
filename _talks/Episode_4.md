In this episode we speak with Wafa Alam and Imran Hossain Mithu from BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University about conducting remote community GIS mapping of informal settlements in Bangladesh. 
We hear about how:
- Young people living in informal settlements joined as co-researchers to map their community for the first time
- How WhatsApp was used to strengthen capacity for mapping and build new skills
- The process of participatory mapping was adapted during COVID-19 restrictions
