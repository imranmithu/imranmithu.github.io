In this podcast, I discussed conducting remote community GIS mapping of informal settlements in Bangladesh. The main discussion points were 

- Young people living in informal settlements joined as co-researchers to map their community for the first time
- How WhatsApp was used to strengthen capacity for mapping and build new skills
- The process of participatory mapping was adapted during COVID-19 restrictions
