Welcome to my website! I am Imran Hossain Mithu, a passionate researcher currently pursuing a PhD in Environmental Health Science at the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona. My academic journey and professional experiences have been deeply rooted in exploring the intersection of public health, environmental science, and data-driven research. With a Master of Public Health from BRAC University and extensive experience in global health projects, my work spans diverse areas such as environmental epidemiology, one health, risk analysis, and surveillance. My dedication to addressing pressing public health challenges, particularly those impacting marginalized communities, drives my research. Through this platform, I aim to share insights from my academic and professional pursuits, connect with fellow researchers, and inspire collaborative solutions for a healthier, more equitable world. Thank you for joining me on this journey toward impactful change.

My research centers on understanding how environmental changes impact human health and developing sustainable solutions to mitigate these effects. As a PhD student in Environmental Health Science at the University of Arizona, I focus on the intersection of climate change, public health, and environmental exposures. Specifically, my work explores the molecular, biochemical, and physiological pathways that underlie health outcomes associated with environmental stressors such as air pollution, extreme heat, and chemical exposures. By leveraging large-scale data-driven approaches—including environmental epidemiology, exposure science, and toxicology—I aim to uncover mechanisms that influence human vulnerability to these challenges. My current projects investigate health outcomes in vulnerable populations, identifying risk factors and mitigation strategies to build resilience in communities facing climate extremes. This research has significant implications for global health and sustainability, addressing the urgent need to safeguard public health in the face of a changing climate. Before joining the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, I contributed to cutting-edge projects addressing infectious diseases and urban health inequities in low-resource settings. My experience includes designing and analyzing qualitative and quantitative studies, training research teams, and applying advanced computational tools for spatial data analysis and risk assessment. Through my interdisciplinary approach, I aim to bridge public health and climate science to advance equitable and effective solutions for health resilience.
