## Research Summary
My research focuses on understanding and addressing the intersections between environmental changes and public health, with a particular emphasis on climate change resilience and neurodegenerative disorders. As an Environmental Health Science researcher, I aim to uncover pathways through which environmental stressors influence health and identify strategies to mitigate their impacts, particularly in vulnerable communities.

### Investigating Greenspaces as Tools for Climate Resilience and Public Health
One of my key projects, led by Dr. Shujuan Li, explores the dual role of urban greenspaces in building resilience to climate change impacts on health. While greenspaces offer significant environmental, social, and health benefits, they also present unintended consequences, such as increased risks of fires, allergens, and vectors of infectious diseases. Our project examines the trade-offs of greenspace composition and morphology, aiming to inform urban planning practices that maximize health benefits while minimizing risks.
Through this study, we:

### 1.Evaluate Public Health Trade-offs
Analyze how different greenspace designs affect heat-related illnesses and mosquito-borne disease risks in urban areas, using Phoenix, AZ, as a case study.

### 2.Develop a Health Effects Assessment Tool
Create a predictive tool leveraging machine learning to evaluate the health impacts of proposed greenspace designs. This tool incorporates data on climate, urban design, and health outcomes and has applications for urban planners to optimize greenspace development.

### 3. Integrate Research and Community Engagement
Facilitate participatory greenspace design activities that co-produce knowledge with community members, eliciting preferences and priorities for resilient urban planning. This integration ensures that our findings are practical and inclusive, addressing inequities in greenspace distribution.

### Climate Change and Neurodegenerative Disorders
In parallel, my work explores the links between climate change and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on how environmental exposures such as extreme heat, air pollution, and chemical contaminants contribute to the onset or exacerbation of these conditions. This research seeks to unravel the biological mechanisms connecting environmental stressors to neurological outcomes, ultimately aiming to develop evidence-based interventions.

### Future Directions
Looking ahead, my research aims to deepen our understanding of how environmental changes impact health, particularly in the context of climate change. I am committed to developing innovative tools and methodologies that bridge environmental science, public health, and community-centered solutions. By advancing the design and implementation of resilient urban systems and unraveling the health implications of environmental exposures, I strive to contribute to healthier, more equitable communities capable of adapting to the challenges of a changing world.
